### A3: Non-thresholded Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)


##### Compute ranks and generate .rnk file

```{r data prepare for A3,echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE,include=FALSE}
qlf_output_hits$tables



qlf_output_hits_merge <- merge(normalized_count_data[,c(1,2)],qlf_output_hits, by.x=0, by.y = 0)

qlf_output_hits_merge[,"rank"] <- -log(qlf_output_hits_merge$PValue,base =10) * sign(qlf_output_hits_merge$logFC)

qlf_output_hits_merge <- qlf_output_hits_merge[order(qlf_output_hits_merge$rank,decreasing = TRUE),]

ranked_result <- as.data.frame(qlf_output_hits_merge[which(qlf_output_hits_merge$PValue < 0.05),][,c("hgnc_symbol","rank")])
dim(ranked_result)

ranked_result <- ranked_result[which(ranked_result$hgnc_symbol != ""),]

dim(ranked_result)

# write.table(ranked_result,file = "ranks.rnk", sep = "\t",
#             row.names = FALSE,col.names = FALSE,quote = FALSE)

Download the "Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_February_01_2020_symbol.gmt" from 
bader lab link: "http://download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets/current_release/Human/symbol/"

#### GSEA parameters

*Required field*
+ Gene sets database:Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_iea_February_01_2020_symbol.gmt
+ Number of permutations:1000
+ collapse/Remap to gene symbols:No_Collapse

*Basic fields*
+ Enrichment statistic: weighted
+ Max size: 200
+ Min size: 15


#### GSEA Result

*Enrichment in phenotype: na*
+ 2310 / 3211 gene sets are upregulated in phenotype na_pos
+ 1158 gene sets are significant at FDR < 25%
+ 522 gene sets are significantly enriched at nominal pvalue < 1%
+ 855 gene sets are significantly enriched at nominal pvalue < 5%



*Enrichment in phenotype: na*

+ 901 / 3211 gene sets are upregulated in phenotype na_neg
+ 566 gene sets are significantly enriched at FDR < 25%
+ 399 gene sets are significantly enriched at nominal pvalue < 1%
+ 487 gene sets are significantly enriched at nominal pvalue < 5%

The top hit for upregulated gene is IMMUNOREGULATORY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN A LYMPHOID AND A NON-LYMPHOID CELL%REACTOME%R-HSA-198933.5

ES = 0.68
NES = 3.38
FDR q-val= 0.000
size = 74 genes

The top hit for downregulated gene is TRANSLATION%REACTOME DATABASE ID RELEASE 71%72766

ES = -0.62
NES = -4.55
FDR q-val = 0.000
size = 129 genes

#### Adding annotation using autoannotate app

![](A3_pics/layout.png)
The top largest annotated clusters are:

+ hh proteasome degradation	
+ decay heterocycle catabolic	
+ electron transport metabolic	
+ mitochondrial translational translation	
+ export nucleus rna	
+ neutrophil migration chemotaxis	
+ secretion regulation protein	
+ cell adhesion activation	
+ ribonucleoprotein biogenesis subunit	
+ migration chemotaxis positive	
+ natural killer immunity	
+ adenylate cyclase coupled	
+ rna processing splicing

#### Interpretation
Do the enrichment results support conclusions or mechanism discussed in the original paper? How do these results differ from the results you got from Assignment #2 thresholded methods?

Yes the enrichment result seems matching with the mechanism discussed in the paper such that the up regulated genes are falls into the categories of "IMMUNOREGULATORY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN A LYMPHOID AND A NON-LYMPHOID CELL"
